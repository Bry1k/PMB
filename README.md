# **About**
A batch script I created that benchmarks applications using [PresentMon](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/tree/main). It's a simple way to benchmark your games with no hassle at all. 

# **How to Use?**
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Bry1k/PMB/releases/tag/0.1)
- Extract the file
- Run the PMB.bat as Admin


# Useful Information
There are different ways you can view the results in the .csv files that are created from PresentMon. I recommend that you use [BoringBoredom's Frame Time Analysis](https://boringboredom.github.io/Frame-Time-Analysis/).
